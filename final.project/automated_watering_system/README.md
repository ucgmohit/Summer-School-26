# Automated Plant Watering System

## Project Description

This project is an IoT-based Automated Plant Watering System developed using Arduino UNO in Tinkercad. The system monitors soil moisture using a Soil Moisture Sensor and light intensity using a Photoresistor (LDR equivalent). A 16×2 LCD displays the soil moisture percentage, operating mode, and pump status. The pump is simulated using an LED. Manual watering is possible using a push button with a 5-minute lockout period.

## Working Principle

1. Reads soil moisture from the sensor.
2. Reads light intensity using the Photoresistor.
3. If soil moisture is below 35% and sufficient light is available, the pump (LED) turns ON automatically.
4. If the Photoresistor detects low light (rain/overcast simulation), watering is skipped.
5. Pressing the push button activates manual watering.
6. Manual watering is disabled for 5 minutes after activation using the `millis()` function.
7. The LCD displays moisture percentage, operating mode, and pump status.

## Moisture Levels

| Moisture (%) | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Below 35% | Dry |
| 35%–70% | Optimal |
| Above 70% | Wet |

## Features

- Automatic irrigation
- Soil moisture monitoring
- Rain detection using Photoresistor
- Manual override button
- LCD status display
- Pump simulation using LED
- Non-blocking lockout using `millis()`

---

## Limitations

This project is implemented in Tinkercad. Therefore:

- The water pump is simulated using an LED.
- The Photoresistor is used instead of an LDR module.
- Google Sheets logging and weather API integration are not supported in Tinkercad.
