Q48: Design Challenge – IoT for Jammu Smart City
Title:
Smart City IoT Solution for Jammu
Introduction

Jammu Smart City can use IoT technology to improve public services.

IoT systems can collect real-time data using sensors.

The collected data can be sent to cloud platforms.

Authorities can monitor and control city services easily.

This proposal includes three IoT solutions:

Smart Street Lighting
Smart Air Quality Monitoring
Smart Waste Management System
1. Smart Street Lighting System
Objective

To reduce electricity consumption by automatically controlling street lights.

Sensors Required
LDR (Photoresistor)
PIR Motion Sensor
Controller and Communication

Microcontroller:

ESP32

Communication:

Wi-Fi
MQTT Protocol
Working

The LDR detects day and night conditions.

During daytime:

Lights remain OFF.

During night:

PIR sensor checks movement.

If motion is detected:

Light brightness increases.

If no motion is detected:

Light brightness decreases.

2. Air Quality Monitoring System
Objective

To monitor pollution and harmful gases in the city.

Sensors Required
MQ-2 Gas Sensor
DHT11 Temperature Sensor
Humidity Sensor
Controller and Communication

Controller:

ESP32

Communication:

Wi-Fi + MQTT

Working

MQ-2 sensor detects smoke and harmful gases.

DHT11 measures:

Temperature
Humidity

If pollution crosses the limit:

Alert is generated.

3. Smart Waste Bin Monitoring
Objective

To monitor garbage level and improve waste collection.

Sensor Required
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Controller
ESP32
Working

The ultrasonic sensor measures the empty space inside the dustbin.

When the bin reaches 80% capacity:

Notification is sent.
Garbage collection team is informed.
